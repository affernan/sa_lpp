# Abstract: 
This article is about the current agricultural scenario, where large-scale production causes large amounts of foodto be transported to various points of consumption, causing substantial emissions of so-called greenhouse gases(GHGs) and increasing the carbon footprint. Land use optimization and land parcel allocation are essential areas of agriculture research that currently represent relevant challenges and classify as combinatorial optimizationproblems. In this context, the Selection and Allocation of Land Parcels Problem (SA-LPP) is proposed; its goal isto optimize the selection and allocation of land parcels in small areas available for food production. We proposea reformulation of the SA-LPP as a variant of the two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem (2OPP), calledGroup-2OPP. This problem was solved through a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, but due tothe model complexity, also we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristicapproach. Some sensitivity analyses were performed as well to evaluate the impact of parameters on the solutions. Computational results show that the proposed metaheuristic outperforms the MILP model in terms of solutionquality and computational times.
